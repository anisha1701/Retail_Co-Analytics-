# 📊 RetailCo Analytics Across Channels

## Executive Summary

This repository contains the detailed analysis and findings for RetailCo's multi-channel performance initiative. [cite_start]The analysis provides a holistic assessment across **sales, profitability, returns, promotions, and inventory**, leveraging six integrated dashboards that examine store-level, category-level, and channel-level KPIs[cite: 23, 24].

[cite_start]**The central challenge identified is a Sales-Profit Imbalance and an over-reliance on the physical store channel (82% of total revenue) [cite: 27, 28][cite_start].** The current operational model exposes RetailCo to systemic leakages in margin and cash flow due to inefficient inventory management, blanket discounting, and underperforming categories[cite: 352].

## 🔍 Core Analysis Sections

The analysis is structured into the following key sections, addressing specific areas of operational and financial leakage:

* [cite_start]**Section 1: The Sales-Profit Imbalance:** Identifies the over-reliance on in-store sales and the need for digital acceleration[cite: 26, 28, 29].
* [cite_start]**Section 2: Category Strength vs. Margin Reality:** Highlights that the top revenue driver, **Electronics Accessories**, suffers from margin erosion due to heavy discounting, and low-performing categories like **Bakery** and **Personal Care** need strategic reevaluation[cite: 63, 64, 66].
* [cite_start]**Section 3: Regional & Store Inefficiencies:** Notes that the **West region** underperforms despite having larger stores, and many stores show high revenue but low net profit[cite: 141, 142, 143].
* [cite_start]**Section 4: Promotions - Lift vs. Margin Erosion:** Reveals that uniform discounting across all categories leads to unnecessary profit loss[cite: 187, 189, 207].
* [cite_start]**Section 5: Returns - Hidden Cost Driver:** **Electronics** leads in return volume due to functional defects, signaling a need for stronger quality control and enhanced online catalog accuracy[cite: 233, 235].
* [cite_start]**Section 6: Inventory Strain & Supply Vulnerabilities:** Shows that **66.3% of inventory** is slow-moving and that a high reorder risk count indicates poor forecasting and supply chain inefficiencies[cite: 287, 288, 289].
